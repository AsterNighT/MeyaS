## MeyaS for Meya Socket
- I'm always feeling proud for my naming.

## What is this?
- A very simple and clumsy encapsulation for winsock.
- Basic error checker and logger.
- A server-broadcast-client-listen server finding model.

## Where can I use this?
- I suppose for your school work only.

## How to use it?
- Build the project with cmake
- Add the include files to your include dir
- Link your project with the lib
- For demos, see test/client.cpp and test/server.cpp

## Other
- define DEBUG_MeyaS to make every error throw an exception.
- define LOG_MeyaS to make every error log its appearance.
